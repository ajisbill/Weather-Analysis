    "* For each month, we will calculate the number of hours that Bellingham was overcast vs the number of hours that Bellingham was not overcast.\n",
    "* Overcast is defined as when 8 oktas of the sky is covered by clouds and dentoted as OVC in the HourlySkyConditions column.\n",
    "* If we make this a ratio (hours overcast / hours not overcast) this will give us a percent of how often it was overcast it was in each month.\n",
    "* We can then put these numbers into a table to compare the months over 2020 and see which were the most overcast."
